# Email App

This is a small project I worked on in my free time. Here are the project details:

**Scenario:** You are an IT Specialist for a company. You are given the task of creating emails for new hires.

**The application should do the following:**
- Determine the first name, last name, and department of the employee
- Generate an email based on this template: firstname.lastname@department.company.com
- Generate a random 8 character string for a password
- Have set methods for names, password, one to set the mailbox capacity, and one to define an alternate email
- Have get methods
- toString and equals methods
